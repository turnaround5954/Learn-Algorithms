# Learn-Algorithms

My solutions to Algorithms I & II on coursera (score: 100/100). <br>
The project structure is a bit messy. <br>
By the time I finished them, I do not know much about Java and Maven (I'm too lazy to learn).

---

I uploaded them here to encourage my friends to polish up their programming skills. <br>
Hope this repository can help those in need :D.
